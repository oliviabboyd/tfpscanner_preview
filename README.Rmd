# tfpscanner : Transmission fitness polymorphism scanner


This package provides an analytical pipeline for rapid variant scanning based on integration of scalable phylogenetic analysis with non-genetic epidemiological data streams. The scanner computes a test statistic for every possible bipartition of the provided phylogeny to identify relative growth rates and relative evolutionary rates of clades with the phylogeny. For every clade in a partitioned tree, matched comparison clades are selected based on time (and if specified, space), for further statistical analyses. 

The main analyses conducted for each clade, or node with included descendants, are as follows:

* Molecular clock outlier statistic using root to tip regression 
* Simple logisitic growth rate estimate
* Generalised additive model (GAM) combined with a Gaussian process model to estimate growth over time

Additional options in the scanning tool may be specified, including:

* (GAM) combined wtih a model of spatial correlation between neighbouring regions to estimate frequency of a clade over time and space
* Other covariate analyses, specified by the user, to run a conditional logistic regression on a specified covariate of interest
* Identification of cluster defining mutations, identified as mutations present in > x% of sequences in the specified cluster and less than x% of sequences in the comparison sample
* MLEsky analyses to estime effective population size (Ne) over time

The output from the scanning tool includes a new output directory, specified as `"tfpscan-{Sys.Date()}"`, along with a rds file containing output descriptives (size, lineage, sample date) and statistics (clock outlier, logistic growth rate, GAM) for every node included and a rds file containing the environment from the scanning tool run. For each node, logistic growth rate p-values as well as suport for logistic model vs. GAM are also reported. 

Within the output directory, the scanning tool creates a further folder directory for each node included in analyses. Node speicifc outputs within individual node directories include seperate csv files with the following: 

* Summary statistics (clock outlier, logstic growth rate, GAM logistic growth rate, support values)
* Sequences with specific sample times, region, and further descriptors reported if included (lineage, mutations, covariate)
* Regional composition of sequences within individual nodes 
* Lineage composition of sequences within individual nodes
* Co-circulating lineage composition from comparison matched sample nodes

Additional options for node specific outputs may be specified, including: 

* GAM figure over time, plotting the logistics odds of a sequences being from the specified node
* Map of GAM + neighbour joining model over space and time (in epi weeks)
* Tree figure for the node of interest, colored by lineage 
* CSV file with defining mutations for cluster of interest specified
* Online tree viewer for the whole phylogeny with linked hover function for statistics associated with each node
